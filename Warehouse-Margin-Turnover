Project Explanation:
The Inventory and Margin Analysis team at the retail headquarters needs to evaluate the gross margin and inventory turnover across different product departments for a defined period 
(August 15, 2020 to January 25, 2021). This analysis will provide insights into profitability and inventory management, aiding in better decision-making for inventory purchases and 
pricing strategies.

1. Define a Common Table Expression (RevenueCost):
   a. Select DepartmentID, and calculate TotalRevenue and TotalCost from Sales table.
   b. Filter records between '2020-08-15' and '2021-01-25'.
   c. Group by DepartmentID.

2. Define another Common Table Expression (AvgInventory):
   a. Select DepartmentID, calculate AverageInventory from Inventory table.
   b. Filter records between '2020-08-15' and '2021-01-25'.
   c. Group by DepartmentID.

3. Final Query:
   a. Join RevenueCost and AvgInventory on DepartmentID.
   b. Select DepartmentID, calculate GrossMargin and InventoryTurnover.

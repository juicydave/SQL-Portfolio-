ORDER BY AverageVolume DESC;



Function Determine Peak Traffic Hours:
    
    Input: Traffic Data Table, Desired Location (e.g., 'Downtown')

    1. Initialize an empty list: HourlyTrafficList

    2. For each record in Traffic Data Table:
        - Check if the Location of the record matches Desired Location

        3. If true:
            a. Extract the hour from the Timestamp of the record
            b. Add the TrafficVolume of the record to the corresponding hour in HourlyTrafficList

    4. Calculate the average traffic volume for each hour in HourlyTrafficList

    5. Sort the HourlyTrafficList in descending order based on the average traffic volume

    6. Return the sorted HourlyTrafficList

End Function

Project Needs:
The demand planning team needs to forecast the next quarter's demand for each product in each region. The forecast should be based on the sales trend of the previous year, 
taking into account the monthly sales growth rate.

WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT
        ProductID,
        RegionID,
        DATE_PART('month', SalesDate) AS SaleMonth,
        SUM(SalesQuantity) AS MonthlySales
    FROM
        Sales
    WHERE
        SalesDate BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
    GROUP BY
        ProductID, RegionID, DATE_PART('month', SalesDate)
),
SalesGrowthRate AS (
    SELECT
        ProductID,
        RegionID,
        AVG(MonthlySales) / LAG(AVG(MonthlySales), 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductID, RegionID ORDER BY SaleMonth) - 1 AS MonthlyGrowthRate
    FROM
        MonthlySales
    GROUP BY
        ProductID, RegionID, SaleMonth
)
SELECT
    ProductID,
    RegionID,
    AVG(MonthlySales) * POWER(1 + AVG(MonthlyGrowthRate), 3) AS ForecastedSales
FROM
    MonthlySales
JOIN
    SalesGrowthRate
USING
    (ProductID, RegionID)
GROUP BY
    ProductID, RegionID;



1. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named MonthlySales:
   a. Select ProductID, RegionID, month of SalesDate, and sum of SalesQuantity from Sales table.
   b. Filter the SalesDate for the year 2022.
   c. Group by ProductID, RegionID, and month of SalesDate.

2. Create another CTE named SalesGrowthRate:
   a. Select ProductID, RegionID, and calculate the monthly growth rate from the MonthlySales CTE.
   b. Group by ProductID, RegionID, and SaleMonth.

3. Select from the MonthlySales and SalesGrowthRate CTEs:
   a. Select ProductID, RegionID, and calculate the forecasted sales for the next quarter based on the average monthly sales and average monthly growth rate.
   b. Group by ProductID and RegionID to get the forecasted sales for each product in each region.

We want to generate a monthly report for the top 10 products that:

    Are either in the 'Electronics' or 'Books' categories.
    Have an average rating greater than 4.
    Have at least one review mentioning 'excellent'.

WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT
        ProductID,
        MONTH(OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,
        SUM(OrderAmount) AS TotalSales
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY ProductID, MONTH(OrderDate)
)

SELECT 
    p.ProductName,
    ms.OrderMonth,
    COALESCE(ms.TotalSales, 0) AS MonthlySales,
    AVG(r.Rating) AS AverageRating,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders,
    CASE
        WHEN AVG(r.Rating) > 4.5 THEN 'Highly Rated'
        ELSE 'Well Rated'
    END AS RatingLabel
FROM Products p
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON p.ProductID = o.ProductID
LEFT JOIN MonthlySales ms ON p.ProductID = ms.ProductID
INNER JOIN Reviews r ON p.ProductID = r.ProductID
WHERE p.Category IN ('Electronics', 'Books')
AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Reviews WHERE ProductID = p.ProductID AND Comment LIKE '%excellent%')
GROUP BY p.ProductName, ms.OrderMonth, ms.TotalSales
HAVING AVG(r.Rating) > 4
ORDER BY MonthlySales DESC, AverageRating DESC
LIMIT 10;



Define a data set "MonthlySales" that:
    For each product and for each month:
        Calculate the total sales from the Orders table

For the main query:
    Start with the Products table
    If the product is in the 'Electronics' or 'Books' category:
        Join the product with its orders using the ProductID
        Join the product with the "MonthlySales" data set using the ProductID
        Join the product with its reviews using the ProductID
        If the product has a review that contains the word 'excellent':
            Calculate:
                The name of the product
                The month of the order
                The total monthly sales (default to 0 if no sales)
                The average rating from the Reviews table
                The total number of orders for the product
                A label 'Highly Rated' if average rating > 4.5, else 'Well Rated'
            Group the results by the product name, order month, and monthly sales
            Only include products with an average rating greater than 4
            Sort the results by monthly sales in descending order and then by average rating in descending order
            Return the top 10 products

Function Generate Monthly Report for Bookstore:

    Input: Books Table, Authors Table, Genres Table, Sales Table, Members Table, ReportMonth

    1. Initialize three empty lists: TopAuthorsList, ProfitableGenresList, and ActiveMembersList

    2. Calculate Top Authors based on sales:

            i. Find the related book from the Books table
            ii. Find the related author from the Authors table
            iii. Accumulate the sale price to the author's total sales

        b. Add the author and their total sales to the TopAuthorsList

    3. Calculate Most Profitable Genres:

        a. For each sale in Sales for the given ReportMonth:
            i. Find the related book from the Books table and its cost price
            ii. Find the related genre from the Genres table
            iii. Calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the sale price
            iv. Accumulate the profit to the genre's total profit

        b. Add the genre and its total profit to the ProfitableGenresList

    4. Identify Active Members:

        a. For each member in Members:
            i. Count the number of distinct books they bought in the given ReportMonth from Sales
            ii. If the count is greater than 5:
                Add the member and their book count to the ActiveMembersList

    5. Sort the TopAuthorsList in descending order based on total sales and take the top 5

    6. Sort the ProfitableGenresList in descending order based on profit and take the top 5

    7. Return TopAuthorsList, ProfitableGenresList, and ActiveMembersList
